Instead of “How can do you get a bigger chunk by taking it away from someone else?” it became “How can we change the pie so that we both get what we want?”

## History
- (1949) Follette: arbitrator who settled labor disputes…she wrote an article about finding creative integrative solutions
- 1965 some people picked up on these ideas
- 1980s Pruitt, Filley, Fischer & Ury

## Three Approaches
### Conflict Styles Approach

#### Accomodative/Smoothing
- believe that disagreeing with someone means that you don’t like them
- wants to keep everyone happy
- people like these people
- feelers

#### Competitive/Forcing
- belief: every dispute involves one party who is right and one party who is wrong
	- believe they are always right
	- it is the obligation of those who are right to change the behavior of those who are wrong
- grad student who couldn’t let other grad student enter data in a less efficient way
- thinkers, cognitively simple

#### Compromise
- Tend to end up splitting the pie
- belief: problem is that everyone wants too much
- assumption: answer lies in a middle-ground between positions
- known as good mediators, though this may not be the case.

#### Avoidant
- belief: conflict is not solvable so best thing to do is avoid it
- tend to be open minded
	- impersonal tolerance: live and let live…let everyone do what they want as long as they don’t influence me.
- *Major Major from Catch 22*
- introverts

#### Collabrative
- Problem Solvers
- I want to get as much as I can get, but I want you to get as much as you can get too
- look for the creative solution
- Question of effort and motivation
- willing to spend a lot of time
- thinkers, most cognitively complex, extroverts

### Procedures Approach: Filley
3 Sets of Procedures

#### Win/Lose (fall nicely into distributive bargaining)
- Most decisions in organizations fall into this.
- Rely on **Authority** to determine who will win: winner is person with the most power.
- **Majority Rule**: Sounds more democratic, but unless you have consensus, those not in the majority do not get what they want.
- **Minority Rule**: A small group makes the decision.
- Rely on **Experts**: not everyone knows the answer so we depend on those with the most knowledge. (Can easily turn into minority rule).
	- *Roloff sometimes does this*
- The people with the most **physical power** decide
- **Smartest decide**

#### Lose/Lose: both parties give something up
- **Compromise**: both parties gain something, but both parties give up something too
- Rely on **rules**: Determine outcome based on previously set rules…you don’t consider both parties needs nor maximize the outcome.
- **Side payments** (bribe): something on the side that gives the person a reason to comply.  Neither side is really accepting this because of the terms of the agreement…they are doing it for outside reasons.
- Bring in **Third Parties**: (*This is ironic because Filley makes part of his living off of this*).  You are losing because you have to pay the third party and you are losing control over the outcome

#### Win/Win
- (Another one we will talk about later in mediation)
- **Consensus Decision Making**: A procedure that leads to integrative decisions
	- Adopt a procedure with no voting and endless discussion
	- Don’t move ahead until everyone agrees that this is the solution
	- NU worked on this model => superficial consensus right before the deadline
	- Quakers in Philadelphia
	- Implied coercion: you keep talking until everyone else gives up.

### Strategy Approach
Pruitt(author) – Logrolling

#### General Characteristics of an Integrative agreement
- Yields high joint benefits
	- Both get what we want, or more than we expected
    - Mutual
- Solution is Non-Obvious
	- Essentially the negotiators did not know the outcome in advance

#### Specific Types of Integrative agreements
**Cost cutting agreement**

- Not tangible, its related to reducing loss of face (image)
- 2 types
	- Precedent Setting
		- If an agreement is reached, I could be setting precedent with them or other people in the future
		- If its set, it reduces my autonomy
		- How to address this concern
			- Deal with this in Private
			- Pledge secrecy
			- Explicitly deny precedent setting (doesn’t always work)
			- Joke about the precedent setting
	- Look Weak
		- Don’t want to feel that the other party feels weak
		- How to minimize other party feeling weak
			- Support that person’s image of strength
			- Attribute compliance to a pro-social motive
			- Make the request sound urgent (so big that noone could turn this down and feel weak)
			- Make the request sound small
			- Make the request sound normative (people routinely grant it)
			- Make it sound like it is the target’s idea
			- Negotiate in private
		- Want to be able to facilitate the target’s ability to say yes
        
**Logrolling**

- I have made concessions on issues that don’t mean much to me, in order to get concessions that matter to me
	- Grew out of politics
- Must be multiple issues on the table of different priority
- One issue is that you're making pragmatic choices instead of showing deep belief

**Non Specific Compensation**

- Offer a new item to the negotiation
	- Often looks like a bribe (which Filley doesn’t like)
	- Its added after the fact
	- If we realize we have the same priorities we can add some more stuff
	- Figuring out what to offer
		- Must provide adequate compensation (i.e. using Foa and Foa’s)
    - Sets precident
        
**Bridging**

- Highly creative solution
- Not restricted by rules or convention
- What conditions need to be met?
	- Talking is better than written
	- Be a creative person
		- Highly dogmatic people are not very creative (don’t have great senses of humor)
        
**Re-Opener Agreement**

- Ability to open the agreement later and re-negotiate
	- Try it and see if it works or you can consider it again later
- If you know they can change their mind in the future, you might not want to put enough into the agreement to make it work

**Unlinking Agreement: pull issues off the table.**

- used when there are multiple issues, most of which we can agree on, and one that we will never reach an agreement on and it is preventing us from making progress
- ways to do it
	- Reach a partial agreement: agree to disagree
		- Takes a high degree of maturity
	- Fractionazation: take a complex proposal, break it into its parts and look at each part separately
		- can be hard: hiring a new faculty member from another department
	- Remove the chance of precedent
		- Similar to cost-cutting strategy
	- Remove someone from the decision process (i.e. if they are strongly attached to a problematic issue)
		- Professor who had trained noone to take his place and decided to retire
        
**Contingent Agreements: you get something if something specific happens in the future**

- athletes salaries are contingent upon performance.  
	- I’ll pay you that much if you can prove you are worth that much

####Conditions for integrative bargaining

- Must be multiple issues on the table
	- Packages: jobs…salary, benefits, etc.
- Search Model
	- Can prepare before you go into negotiation
	- What it generally looks like
		- Set a **goal** (similar to level of aspiration)
		- Identify all of the ways the opponent can meet that goal
		- Prioritize each of the means by which you can meet the larger goal
		- If they reject the package, don’t lower your goal, just shift the weight across the other ways you indentified
        
####Strategies

**information exchange**

- it is more important to disclose info about priorities than goals
- it is better to ask questions than to disclose info
	- signals to the other side that you care about them
- use of numerical info (as opposed to feelings) is helpful if you are a number person, otherwise it doesn’t make much of a difference
- what do all of these have in common
	- explicit: tell specific info about priorities, etc.
		- direct and efficient
doesn’t address what happens if there is low trust
what to do if there is low trust
implied: hinting enough to make inferences
good if you don’t trust eachother.
Talk time: spend most of your time talking about the most important issues
Directed attention: don’t tell them what the priority is, but point out what area of the offer could be improved
Show enthusiasm when discussing their high priority issue
Don’t work well if the other person doesn’t see these implied methods
Contentiousness
Being argumentative
Being coercive
Reduces the likelihood of finding an integrative agreement
What is the best way to be tough
Avoid challenging their needs  instead challenge the desirability/workability of their offer
Signal flexibility while engaging in contentious behavior
Remind the other side that you want to reach an agreement
Be contentious at different points in the negotiation
Phase 1: Tough (high contentiousness)
Sets an impression
Phase 2: Problem solvers
bargaining strategy
logrolling
low priority concession making
sequential strategy: go issue by issue reaching an agreement. You can return to an earlier issue
takes a long time
if you can’t reach an agreement on one, you might get hung up talking about one issue
what if there is low trust? 
heuristic trial and error: routinely refuse to make concessions on high priority issues and only make concessions on the low priority issues
works even in low trust situations
flexible rigidity: flexible as to the means of goal attainment, but rigid as to the goal itself
rigid rigidity (here’s what I want and here is the only way to achieve it) is bad because you have trouble reaching a goal
flexible flexibility is bad because you give up to much and walk away with a bad agreement
How do I stay rigid to my goals?
Have high goals (levels of aspiration)
Tend to spend more effort to achieve them
If you are accountable to a constituency
If you represent someone else, you can’t automatically lower your goal as easily
How do you stay flexible in your means of goal attainment?
Have a problem solving orientation: care about the relationship with the other person
Think about the future and dealing with this other party again
Fisher & Ury: Interest Negotiation (Getting to Yes)
Positional (Soft and Tough) vs. Principaled
Positional: exchange of offers
Principaled: interest (what you really want to get out of the negotiation) focused
Difficult to figure out what an interest is because it keeps changing
Positional Approach














Criticism: “this is unrealistic as hell”
What you do if they won’t engage in Principaled Negotiation?
Don’t push back
Identify the tactic, condmen it, but don’t condemn them
Invite criticism
Ask Questions/Paraphrase: they get a chance to correct you and shows that you’ve been listening
develop a BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)
what can you do if you don’t reach an agreement
don’t use it as a weapon…it is a shield not a sword: it keeps you confident so that the other side can’t intimidate you
Ury & Brown: Working Together
Two fundamental problems that lead to bad relationships
Assumed similarity: we tend to assume others think just like we do
Expect reciprocity: if we do nice things for other people, they will do something nice back
What should you do?: Respond in a counter-intuitive way
If they are irrational  you should stay rational
If they misunderstand you  try to understand them
refuse to talk to you  try to talk to them
If they are unreliable  try to be reliable
If they are coercive  remain noncoercive
If they reject you  try to accept them
Fisher & Brown: Getting Past No: Dealing With Difficult People
If you are dealing with an overly competitive person
don’t react: “Go to the balcony” or take a time-out
If you are dealing with the other person’s negative emotion 
step to their side and try to discover what their interest must be
Other person’s positional behavior (won’t talk about interests just keep making offers)
change the game by reframing it 
they are skeptical about your offers
“build them a golden bridge”: get them involved in constructing their offer so that they see that it meets their interests
they have more power than you
bring them to their senses, not to their knees
don’t be afraid to consult your BATNA
 Jerky Personalities
Machiavellians (Christie & Geiss)
Based on Machiavelli’s The Prince
maintain emotional control: don’t get angry, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t act like they’re angry
low ideological commitment: don’t believe in any value system or beliefs.  Can change ideologies easily
low commitment to social morality: don’t have any sense of ethics… “unencumbered by ethics”
deceptive
do NOT suffer from gross psycho-pathology: they’re not psychotic or neurotic
Assumed that high machs would be more effective in negotiation…sometimes
Depends what the outcomes look like
When there is no value to winning…no difference between high and low machs
As you increase the outcomes, high machs become more successful negotiators than low machs
 high machs don’t exhibit these personality traits unless the outcome is of value to them
when high machs are paid on commission they are more productive than low machs…if they are paid on a flat rate, low and high machs are equally productive
Northwestern has a higher percentage of Machiavellians than the rest of the world.
There are some occupations that attract high mach  attorneys, sales people, and politicians
If you can show that what you are doing is in their best interest, they will do it
Once you get them on board, watch them because they might not follow through
Some studies say we all have some level of machiavellianism
Dogmatism (Rokeach) 
Built onto authoritiism
Close minded, regardless of your political stance
reject alternative belief systems: believe there is only one way to look at things
in interviews they will ask questions about beliefs and won’t recommend you if your beliefs are different from theirs
believe authorities: they tend to accept authority figures
future oriented: low dogs focus on past, present, and future.  High dogs only think about the future
uncreative: cognitively simple (can’t view things from multiple angles and perspectives)
problems in negotiation
not good at integrative bargaining
can’t find non-obvious solutions
in distributive bargaining
make few concessions
try to be threatening and use coercion 
view compromise as defeat
how to deal with them in negotiation
try to show your similarity to them
align yourself with authority figures they respect
Verbally Aggressive 
primary way of getting what they want is to insult other people
how did they get this way?
they were raised in families with aggressive people
it works  they get what they want by acting in a verbally aggressive way
two-faced orientation – they believe that they way they insult others it is not as bad as if it came back to them
aren’t very good at reasoning and logic
cognitively simple  substitute intimidation for reasoning
what are their methods?
They attack character
They attack competency
what to do?
fighting back does not help because they view it as an overreaction and see themselves as the victim of your aggression 
instead, maintain composure and stay focused on the issue without losing it.
Jerky Behavior
Good Guy/Bad Guy Strategy
Police interrogation
Does it matter what the order is?
Bad guy, then good guy is better than the other way around…Why?
When the bad guy comes in we lower out level of aspiration and then the good guy capitalizes on low level of aspiration
You feel so kindly toward the good guy that you feel obligated to reach an agreement
We are so afraid of the bad guy, we reach an agreement with the good guy to avoid the bad guy coming back
The more times someone confronts this strategy, the less they are effected by it
Common Value Strategy
You pretend to be interested in something to manipulate the other person into giving you what you really want
Two ways to do this
Sin of Commission: walk in and lie about your priorities
Sin of Omission: allow other party to continue their misperception
Sin of Omission is more common
Best way to deal with this is to directly confront them
Sand Bagging Strategy
Pretend to be in a weakened condition to get concessions from the other side
People tended to make concessions
Who is most likely to use this strategy?
Low machs tend to sandbag more than high machs
Emotional Display Strategy
Using emotion to get what you want
when someone loses it during the negotiation, shouting increases concession making
Conflict Escalation
In Process
Avoid
Overmatching: they threaten to do something to you and you counter with a worse threat
What Works
Reciprocate, but condemn: They threaten you and you respond in kind, but indicate that you did not want to
You indicate that you are strong and not easily pushed around
Also indicate that you don’t think this is a good way to continue
Ignore, but condemn: They threaten you and you don’t reciprocate, but you condemn it
Doesn’t work as well as reciprocating because you don’t demonstrate strength
After the Negotiation
GRIT (Graduated Reduction In Tension) Osgood  Post Cold War
Lack of Trust: primary problem with the conflict escalation
A unilateral strategy
A public official announces the desire to reduce tension
announces a unilateral concession
the concession must be specific
One side could offer to destroy a certain weapons system
invite verification
it must be carried out on time
These first five steps are to establish objective credibility
announce another concession, regardless of what they do
it takes a while to build back trust
eventually invite, but do not demand reciprocation
diversify concessions
don’t make all of your concessions in one military area so that you are not incapable of retaliation
gauge and match future concessions for risk
eventually if the other side doesn’t step up, you have to be willing to walk away and now it is their problem
Never got to test this in a macro sense, but did test it in the lab
Which steps are most critical?
public announcement of desire to reduce tension
specific concessions
it must be carried out on time
invite, but don’t demand concessions
gauging the risk  if you keep making concessions without reciprocation, you make yourself vulnerable
How do you get the two parties that are escalating together as a third party?
Intractable Disputes: two parties have dug in and refuse to move
Coleman: Intractable Dispute flow from the following things:
They involve values
Issues are central to the parties (i.e. security, land, etc.)
Typically involve coercion and losses
They’ve been going on a long time and the parties are really hurting eachother
Typically involve support
Someone is willing to provide the parties support
Ripeness: is the conflict ripe for resolution?
A couple of ways this occurs
Denial of resources (external)
The ongoing dispute in Ireland
Internal Dissent
As long as enough people think that the fight is winnable, it will keep going
Vietnam
