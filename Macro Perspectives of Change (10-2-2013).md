"Curb your enthusiasm."

# Evolutionary approaches.

## variation---selection---retention

- population scarcity
- environmental selection: some things are going to fail.
- competition.

## Downs

1. Shrinking violet syndrome
	- defensive posture to hold market
    - after encountering a personal failure
2. Superman syndrome
	- infringe on other tasks
    - leads to shrinking violet
    - idea that company can do anything
    - happens after major successes

## Kotter and Heskett, Cultural approach

### Three Types of Cultures

1. Strong culture
	- Has existed in the US for a long time
    - Generally has a founder with an uncanny insight into the market
    - Imposed philisophical outlook on the company
    - Works as long as the market doesn't change
2. Strategically appropriate culture
	- Partially market driven 
    - People who founded the company did market research
    - Stopped doing market research after start
    - Works as long as the market doesn't change
3. Adaptive culture
	- Constant Change
    - Constantly assessing the market and making changes based on that
    - Must hire the right kind of employees
    - Requires an incredible amount of effort

## Dialectic

Encourage confrontation and conflict over ideas. Conflict creates good ideas.

### thesis vs. anthesis---conflict---synthesis

1. Diversity
2. Confrontation
3. Conflict

### Downs

1. Forces of inertia
	- Sunk costs
	- Size/cost of innovation
	- Self-interest
2. Force of change
	- Desire to a good job.
	- Desire for aggrandizement
	- Self-defense (If you don't change, you'll die.)

### Paradox of Group Decision-making
Anything that increases the quality of decision making decreases the chances of implementation.

1. Task conflict
	- Group spends all of its time arguing about solutions
2. Emotional conflict
	- Anger towards other people during the deliberation
    - Causes people to actively or passively defeat this decision
3. Solutions
	- dialectical
    	- The reasons that groups don't work in open conflict is a perception of coteries.
        - Define subgroups with specific tasks, breaking natural coteries.
        - Assumes that subgroups can reach a decision easier.
        - Doesn't work.
	- devil’s advocate
    	- Assign someone specifically to be a critic
        - Removes it from being personal
        - Only kind of works
	- consensus

## Attraction-selection-attrition.

Key to working in an organization is having your personality fit the organizations.

1. Fit-employee
	- Personality
    	- Innovative: Open Minded (but not highly conscientious)
        - Detail Oriented: Highly Conscientious
        - Aggressive: Extraverts but not open, attracts disagreeable people
        - Outcome-oriented: Conscientious
        - Supportive: Agreeable
        - Reward Oriented: Disagreeable
        - Decisive: Disagreeable
        - Team Oriented: Extraverts and discourage conscientious people
	- Value
	- Work Style
2. Fit-organization
	- Culture
    	- There are six (eight?) cultures
        - 1. Innovative
        - 2. Detailed
        - 3. Agressive
        - 4. Outcome oriented
        - 5. Supportive
        - 6. Reward Oriented
        - 7. Decisive
        - 8. Team oriented
	- Workgroup
	- Job
3. Applications.
4. Recruitment
	- Recruiters can identify whether or not you will fit
    - If you are likeable, they will be biased towards you
    - If you have excellent credentials, they will be biased towards you
    - If you are attractive, they will be biased towards you
5. Attrition.
6. Effects:  Similarity

**Strategy for getting a job:**

- Opinion Conformity does not work.
- Complimentary does not work.
- Credentials does work.
- Likeability (Smiling) does not work.
- Fit is more effective than any other strategy.

**Problem**

- People lie
	- Slight image creation (enhancing fit)
    - Extensive image creation (build stories by arranging work experiences, invent things in your background)
    - Image protection (omitting bad things from your background or masking them)
    - Engratiation (make the interviewer feel better)
    - Done by high self-monitors and high-machavellians.
    - Extensive image creation works really well.
    - Image protection hurts your chances.
    - Asking follow-up questions of the applicant enhances the abilities of the liars.
    
**Overall Research**

- Job fit reduces stress
- Job fit increases job satisfaction
- Low job fit doesn't predict quitting
- Hiring practices reinforce inertia

# Life cycle perspectives

## Downs

1. Growth accelerator effect.
	- Stimulus event
	- Infusion of capital
	- Expanding tasks
2. Decelerator effect.
	- Internal competition for resources
	- Decrease in talent
	- Hard to replicate initial success.
3. Result
	- Death
	- Reinvention

## Gersick

1. Equilibrium change.
	- Maintaining/carrying out functions
	- Superficial adjustment
	- Forces to resist change.
		- Cognition-know one way to look at things.
		- Motivation-fear of change.
		-  Obligations to stakeholders
		-  Benefits.
2. Revolutionary change.
	- Change in the deep structure of an organization.  Culture.
	- Causes
		- Internal changes
		- External changes.
		- Crises/failure/time pressure.
3. Patterns of revolutionary change.
	- Slow rather than fast.
	- Nonlinear rather than linear.
	- Failure with success.
	- Central areas first then branch out

## Geiner, Life phases of an organization.

### Phase 3
- Evolution: Growth through delegation.
- Revolution: Crisis of control.

### Phase 4

- Revolution: Crisis of red tape.

### Phase 5

# Teleology

## Dissatisfaction—Search/interact—Set-envision goals—Implement goals.

## Downs-Performance gaps.

### Causes
- Inevitable internal turnover.
- Internal technological change.
- Repercussions of own performance.
- External factors.

### How organizations react.
- Do nothing.
- Conform to view of stakeholders
- Deny there is no gap.
- Convince others to change expectations.
- Change stakeholders.

### Biases
- Screen out alternatives that hurt self.
- Give more weight to alternatives that benefit self.
- Won’t totally comply with all changes.
- Distort information to look good.

### Types of managers.

- Mixed motive.  Care about self and organization.
	- Advocates-care about department.
	- Statesmen-care about organization.
	- Zealots-care about policy

### Search problems.
- time pressure
	- Consider minimal alternatives
	- Biases become greater.
	- Restrict participants.
- Costs
