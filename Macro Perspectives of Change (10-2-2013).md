"Curb your enthusiasm."

# Evolutionary approaches.

## variation---selection---retention

- population scarcity
- environmental selection: some things are going to fail.
- competition.

## Downs

1. Shrinking violet syndrome
	- defensive posture to hold market
    - after encountering a personal failure
2. Superman syndrome
	- infringe on other tasks
    - leads to shrinking violet
    - idea that company can do anything
    - happens after major successes

## Kotter and Heskett, Cultural approach

### Three Types of Cultures

1. Strong culture
	- Has existed in the US for a long time
    - Generally has a founder with an uncanny insight into the market
    - Imposed philisophical outlook on the company
    - Works as long as the market doesn't change
2. Strategically appropriate culture
	- Partially market driven 
    - People who founded the company did market research
    - Stopped doing market research after start
    - Works as long as the market doesn't change
3. Adaptive culture
	- Constant Change
    - Constantly assessing the market and making changes based on that
    - Must hire the right kind of employees
    - Requires an incredible amount of effort

## Dialectic

Encourage confrontation and conflict over ideas. Conflict creates good ideas.

### thesis vs. anthesis---conflict---synthesis

1. Diversity
2. Confrontation
3. Conflict

### Downs

1. Forces of inertia
	- Sunk costs
	- Size/cost of innovation
	- Self-interest
2. Force of change
	- Desire to a good job.
	- Desire for aggrandizement
	- Self-defense (If you don't change, you'll die.)

### Paradox of Group Decision-making
Anything that increases the quality of decision making decreases the chances of implementation.

1. Task conflict
	- Group spends all of its time arguing about solutions
2. Emotional conflict
	- Anger towards other people during the deliberation
    - Causes people to actively or passively defeat this decision
3. Solutions
	- dialectical
    	- The reasons that groups don't work in open conflict is a perception of coteries.
        - Define subgroups with specific tasks, breaking natural coteries.
        - Assumes that subgroups can reach a decision easier.
        - Doesn't work.
	- devil’s advocate
    	- Assign someone specifically to be a critic
        - Removes it from being personal
        - Only kind of works
	- consensus

## Attraction-selection-attrition.

Key to working in an organization is having your personality fit the organizations.

1. Fit-employee
	- Personality
    	- Innovative: Open Minded (but not highly conscientious)
        - Detail Oriented: Highly Conscientious
        - Aggressive: Extraverts but not open, attracts disagreeable people
        - Outcome-oriented: Conscientious
        - Supportive: Agreeable
        - Reward Oriented: Disagreeable
        - Decisive: Disagreeable
        - Team Oriented: Extraverts and discourage conscientious people
	- Value
	- Work Style
2. Fit-organization
	- Culture
    	- There are six (eight?) cultures
        - 1. Innovative
        - 2. Detailed
        - 3. Agressive
        - 4. Outcome oriented
        - 5. Supportive
        - 6. Reward Oriented
        - 7. Decisive
        - 8. Team oriented
	- Workgroup
	- Job
3. Applications.
4. Recruitment
	- Recruiters can identify whether or not you will fit
    - If you are likeable, they will be biased towards you
    - If you have excellent credentials, they will be biased towards you
    - If you are attractive, they will be biased towards you
5. Attrition.
6. Effects:  Similarity

**Strategy for getting a job:**

- Opinion Conformity does not work.
- Complimentary does not work.
- Credentials does work.
- Likeability (Smiling) does not work.
- Fit is more effective than any other strategy.

**Problem**

- People lie
	- Slight image creation (enhancing fit)
    - Extensive image creation (build stories by arranging work experiences, invent things in your background)
    - Image protection (omitting bad things from your background or masking them)
    - Engratiation (make the interviewer feel better)
    - Done by high self-monitors and high-machavellians.
    - Extensive image creation works really well.
    - Image protection hurts your chances.
    - Asking follow-up questions of the applicant enhances the abilities of the liars.
    
**Overall Research**

- Job fit reduces stress
- Job fit increases job satisfaction
- Low job fit doesn't predict quitting
- Hiring practices reinforce inertia

# Life cycle perspectives

Organizations go through stages of life.

## Downs

1. Growth accelerator effect.
	- Stimulus event
	- Infusion of capital
	- Expanding tasks
    - Creates an age lump: a time where you hire a bunch of people who are all similar reducing amount of upward mobility
2. Decelerator effect.
	- Competition for resources
	- Decrease in talent
    	- As you hire more people, you hire bodies instead of talent
        - Stay small.
	- Hard to replicate initial success.
3. Result
	- Death
    	- Blinding: Not paying attention to signs that things aren't going well
        - Inaction: Not acting on signs that things are going wrong
        - Faulty Action: Making things worse
        - Crisis: Blood in the hallways
        - Death
	- Reinvention
    	- Find a new cause
    - Mergers and acquistions
    	- Bad on employees
        - Culture clash

## Gersick

1. Equilibrium change.
	- Maintaining/carrying out functions
	- Superficial adjustment
    - This works because it focuses on small changes
	- Forces to resist bigger change.
		- Cognition: know one way to look at things.
		- Motivation: fear of change.
		- Obligations to stakeholders
		- Benefits.
2. Revolutionary change.
	- Change in the deep structure of an organization.  Culture.
    - Rarely occurs.
	- Causes
		- Internal changes
		- External changes.
		- Usually due to Crises/failure/time pressure.
	- Patterns of revolutionary change.
		- Slow rather than fast.
		- Nonlinear rather than linear.
		- Failure with success.
		- Central areas first then branch out
        	- This leads to success
            - Jail theory

## Geiner, Life phases of an organization.

### Phase 1 

- Evolution: Growth through creativity.
	- Disorganized and fun.
- Revolution: Crisis of leadership
	- No one knows how to run a company. Someone must take charge.

### Phase 2

- Evolution: Growth through direction.
	- Someone starts leading.
- Revolution: Crisis of autonomy.
	- Pushback from leadership. Coup to throw out the leader.

### Phase 3

- Evolution: Growth through delegation.
	- Start delegating tasks and decisions.
    - People do whatever they want
- Revolution: Crisis of control.
	- Reaction to inefficiency and chaos.

### Phase 4

- Evolution: Growth through coordination.
	- Control by committees: BUREAUCRACY
- Revolution: Crisis of red tape.
	- Goodness, everything takes forever.

### Phase 5

- Evolution: Growth through collaboration.
- Revolution: Crisis of ????

Basically the ebb and flow of chaos and order.

# Teleology Approach

Organizations can do something to create control.

## Dissatisfaction—Search/interact—Set-envision goals—Implement goals.

## Downs - Performance gaps.
- Constant comparison of performance goals.
- Disincentive for meeting goals

### Causes

- Inevitable internal turnover.
- Internal technological change.
- Repercussions of own performance.
- External factors.

### How organizations react.

- Do nothing.
	- Often the scenario when knowledge is only internal
- Conform to view of stakeholders
- Deny there is a gap. Lie.
- Convince others to change expectations.
- Change stakeholders.

### Biases for solutions

- Screen out alternatives that hurt self.
- Give more weight to alternatives that benefit self.
- Won’t totally comply with all changes.
- Distort information to look good.
- Biases stronger in some people than others.

### Types of managers.

- Self-interested.
	- Climbers: maximize own power, income and prestige.
    	- Press for early promotion
        - First tactic is aggrandizing
        - Next tactic to jump ship
        - Change oriented people
        - increases decelleration effect
	- Conservers: maintain own power, income and presige.
    	- Often climbers who rose to the level where they can't climb any more
        - Middle Management
        - Often Middle Aged
        - Often part of an age lump
        - As time goes on, you will eventually become a conserver.
- Mixed motive.  Care about self and organization.
	- Advocates: care about department.
    	- Advocates for anything in their unit
        - Make good unit heads
        - Even-handed internally
        - Aggressive in resources aquistion
	- Statesmen: care about organization.
    	- Identify with the organization over the department
        - Will sacrifice resources of department for good of the organization
        - Big picture view
	- Zealots: care about policy
    	- Does not identify with organization or department
        - Identifies with a CAUSE.
        - Pushes cause relentlessly.

### Search problems.

- time pressure
	- Consider minimal alternatives
	- Biases become greater.
	- Restrict participants.
- Costs
